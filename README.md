Project Description

Live Demo: https://shadientco-project.netlify.app/

This is a dark-themed animated website built using various libraries, including SwiperJS, LocomotiveJS, GSAP ScrollTrigger, and more.

Challenges & Solutions

During development, I encountered an issue where LocomotiveJS hijacked the scroll functionality, preventing other scroll events from working. After researching, I found a helpful article with a code snippet that resolved the issue.

Reference: GSAP ScrollTrigger Scroller Proxy
